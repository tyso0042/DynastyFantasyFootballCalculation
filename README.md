# Background

I play in a few "keeper" leagues for fantasy football, where you can keep a few players on your team based on where you drafted them the previous year, with a penalty each year. Best case scenario, you draft a really great but unknown/untested player in the last few rounds of the draft, and you get to "keep" them on your team the next few years. 

For example, let's say you picked up a rookie like **Justin Jefferson**, WR Minnesota Vikings, in the 13th round of the 2020 Fantasy Football draft. Then he has one of the best rookie WR seasons of all time, so when you are choosing who to keep for the 2021 Fantasy Football draft, his 2021 value has increased tremendously. He is being drafted in other leagues in the 2nd round, and you can keep him in the:
*13th round - (Keeper round Penalty, lets say its 1 round) =* **12th round**

This means you are getting a consensus 2nd round pick in the 12th round, or *10 rounds* of value. If you have 10 teams in your fantasy football league, that means 10 team * 10 rounds/picks per team = **100 picks**. I call that "Overall Value" through the code and visualizations.
